        Born from the wild idea of improving everyday debugging life, Quacky
        Coders was created by two passionate developers who longed to bring fun
        and creativity to the problem-solving process. Inspired by their own
        love for rubber duck debugging, they embarked on a journey to spice up
        the working desk of developers around the world with charming and quirky
        rubber ducks.
